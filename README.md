# merle
A Linux compatibility layer configuration tool.

Merle gives you recommended configs for maximizing compatibility when running Windows apps thorugh a compatibility layer such as Wine or Proton.
Taking into account user-submitted information from resources such as ProtonDB, Merle takes your hardware, os/distro, display server, and desktop environment into account to give you the smoothest experience possible.

**NOTE: This was originally a personal project that other people showed interest in. I am currently reworking Merle into being more user friendly, please bear with me as I rework it.**
*Downloads will be available as soon as I get it in a presentable state.*

Merle has been tested on Arch and Debian-based systems but plans to support most major distros.
